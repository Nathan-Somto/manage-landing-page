### What I learned

In the Project i made use of SASS a css libary  that gives css superpowers. this is my first time using sass and to be honest i love it.
Made my workflow easy. so now i can say sass is my second best css framework after tailwindcs  :)

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```



### Continued development

i am  going to give sass a go in my future front-end projects involving frameworks like react and nextjs.
